# udp-test

A small sample application for sending data over udp. This application is written in C++ and relies on QT.

A buffer representing a block of user data (such as an image) is sent repeatedly by a timer. Each send call
splits the buffer into smaller datagrams to avoid packet fragmentation. Additional portions of the code mimic
the design of an existing application.
